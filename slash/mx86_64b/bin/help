\033[1;36m2. Network utilities
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- Remote computing
\033[1;0mMobaXterm includes some useful clients for executing commands on 
remote computers. For instance, you can use the OpenSSH clients suite:
. ssh (utility to access shell accounts using a secure crypted connection)
. sftp (utility to browse remote folders using a secure crypted connection)
. scp (utility to copy remote files using a secure crypted connection)
Do not forget that you can define sessions in MobaXterm
(see the corresponding section for more information). You can also set up
passwordless connections with ssh, there is also a corresponding 
section for this feature.


\033[1;32m- DISPLAY settings
\033[1;0mMobaXterm includes an X server so that it can display X11-based 
graphical programs.
By default, an X server is started at MobaXterm startup. Your DISPLAY 
environment variable is automatically set and it is written in your terminal 
startup message. When you use a remote computing client to connect to a Unix 
computer, you can export your DISPLAY to your local Windows desktop thanks to 
MobaXterm. When you use a SSH connection, if the remote server supports X11-
Forwarding, your DISPLAY is automatically set and it will be sent through the 
SSH connection to your Windows desktop.
Note: if you have troubles with some old graphical programs (Motif-based programs 
for example), you can also run a full window manager by clicking on the 
corresponding button in the top toolbar.
\033[1;35mssh -l root remoteserver1
nedit
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- Xdmcp session
\033[1;0mMobaXterm includes XDMCP capabilities for opening a remote desktop in 
a Windows frame. This protocol allows you to show the full remote desktop just 
like an old Terminal X. All you have to do is clicking on the corresponding 
button in the top toolbar.


\033[1;32m- Network monitoring
\033[1;0mMobaXterm includes some useful utilities for monitoring your network:
. TCPCapture (allows you to capture network packets)
. MobaListPorts (allows you to list all open ports with their current state)
. iperf (monitor the available bandwidth on your network)

\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- Tabbed interface
\033[1;0mMobaXterm can start several independent terminals thanks to a tab-
based interface.
Use the appropriate button to create new tabs, close existing tabs, cycling 
through tabs or rename tabs.


\033[1;32m- Split modes
\033[1;0mMobaXterm allows you to display some terminals in the same Window just 
as you would do using the \"screen\" utility.
You can display 2 terminals in horizontal or vertical mode, or even 4 terminals 
in the same Window

\033[1;0mMobaXterm allows you to save your terminal output to a file, or to 
print it using the appropriate buttons from the top toolbar.

\033[1;0mYou can edit your options using the corresponding button from the top 
toolbar. Your options will be saved to an INI file. You can select a persistent 
home directory for keeping your files and parameters instead of having your 
home directory in a temporary folder. You can also select the terminal fonts, 
colors, skin, etc...


\033[1;32m- Sessions
\033[1;0mYou can store your connection settings in sessions that are stored in 
your INI file. These sessions can be accessed easily through the sessions tree
in the left sidebar. You can also create a desktop shortcut of each session 
in order to launch them easily.

features)

or the "mobapt" command.
. apt-get is a commandline package manager which works with <TAB> completion

\033[1;36m5. How to set up a passwordless ssh connection
\033[1;0m

You can connect to an SSH server without supplying any password: this is useful 
if you want to run shell scripts that are not interactive. This can be done in 
2 steps:

\033[1;32m- On client side
\033[1;0mYou will have to generate a public rsa key on the client. This can be 
done by typing
\033[1;35mssh-keygen -t rsa 
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- On server side
\033[1;0mCopy the file that has been generated on the client
(\".ssh/id_rsa.pub\") to the ~/.ssh/ directory of the server and rename it to
\"authorized_keys\".
\033[1;35mscp .ssh/id_rsa.pub user1@server1:.ssh/authorized_keys
\033[1;0m




\033[1;36m6. How to execute a shell script at MobaXterm startup
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- Using commandline parameters
\033[1;0mYou can edit a shell script (be careful, it has to be in Unix and not 
Dos format) and run it at MobaXterm startup. You just have to launch MobaXterm 
with the following command line:
\033[1;35mMobaXterm.exe <script_file> 
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- Using bookmarks
\033[1;0mCreate a new bookmark, select the \"Custom shell script\" option in 
the dropdown menu and edit your shell script. You can then click on your 
bookmark and choose to create a desktop shortcut to this bookmark.
